## Introduction

This repository includes machine learning models and projects that I developed during my internship at CodeAlpha. Each project is organized in its own directory with relevant code, data, and documentation.

## Projects

### Task 1: Credit Scoring Model

- **Description**: Developed a credit scoring model to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on historical financial data. Utilized classification algorithms and assessed the model's accuracy.
- **Techniques Used**: Data Preprocessing, Logistic Regression.
- **Directory**: `Credit-Scoring-Model`
- **Dataset**: [Credit Scoring Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/bank-credit-scoring)

### Task 2: Disease Prediction Model

- **Description**: Created a model to predict the likelihood of a disease based on medical data such as symptoms and patient history. Used labeled datasets with medical records and applied classification algorithms.
- **Techniques Used**: Data Preprocessing, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines
- **Directory**: `Disease-Prediction`
- **Dataset**: [Medical Data Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning)
